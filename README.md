    - Contact information such as: phone number, email and instagram.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used throughout this application is:

This application was built using ReactJS and multiple hooks to maintain state throughout. Most state was passed through components through props as this application wasnt complex enough for the use of useContext or redux.
